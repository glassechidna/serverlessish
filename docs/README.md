This project mostly served as a proof-of-concept. It's still functional, but I
would recommend that folks interested in a webservers-on-Lambda experience instead
use [`apparentorder/reweb`][reweb] - it is maintained, has high-quality docs
and many examples.

The old README for this project is still available [here][old-readme].

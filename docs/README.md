This project mostly served as a proof-of-concept. It's still functional, but I
would recommend that folks interested in a webservers-on-Lambda experience instead
use [`apparentorder/reweb`][reweb] or [`awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter`][web-adapter].
They are maintained, have high-quality docs and many examples.

The old README for this project is still available [here][old-readme].

[reweb]: https://github.com/apparentorder/reweb
[web-adapter]: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter
[old-readme]: /docs/README.old.md
